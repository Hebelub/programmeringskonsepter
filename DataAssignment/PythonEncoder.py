This Python script is responsible for encoding puzzle data from a text format
to a binary format using Protocol Buffers. The binary format is designed to be
more compact and faster for machine-to-machine communication. This script will
take puzzle data in a text-based format, convert it into a Protocol Buffers message,
and then serialize it into a binary string.
